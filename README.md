The Project:
With the recent revival of the direwolf, perhaps you have been curious about when the modern wolf split off from the direwolfs, or their mot recent common ancestor. We propose an ap that would take two user input animals and with a database, it can provide a time range of when these most likely split off. This app would be monetized by advertisements.
